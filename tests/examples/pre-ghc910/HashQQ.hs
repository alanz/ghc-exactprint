# The table below contains both registered and (common) unregistered types.
# A type that has no unique extension can be ignored -- they are listed
# here to guide configurations toward known types and to make it easier to
# identify "new" types.  File extensions are also commonly used to indicate
# content languages and encodings, so choose them carefully.
